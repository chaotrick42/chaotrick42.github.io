Off to new `Adentures` , now that I left my last position at Piazza Blu. I currently adjust my portfolio and started to work on my repo´s again. Feels like a whole `lifetime`, but still my journey started two years ago(which is just a blink of a moment).

As adjustments always require some work, please bear with my naked page and empty repo list. Things that will follow are:

`CSS Tricks, JavaScript Sourcery, Backend Optimizations and much more`

If you are just to curios and cannot wait `Stop it!` cause good things need some time, `Rome` was not build within a day `Giza Pyramid` didn´t pop out and even `Elon` took his time to buy twitter.

Here goes a little story of my dog Vader:

{% highlight ruby %}
HE shat in my Hand(really)
ME "What a shitty situation"
end

Sometimes things get dirty but you still like em, like coding!
{% endhighlight %}
