Working on new lang´s can be `hard` , but after some time you get used to the syntax. I currently work on my `github.io` page. Feels like a whole new `galaxy` since I had a look last time, but still it´s very nice to see how fast things can change and new possibilities are available!

New to my portfolio will be:

`Jekyll, Ruby and more SASS`

If you are wondering what the little Lord is doing `say no more` cause as it is `Fall` he just had his first fallen leaf bath! `Anything` that you can dive into but is not water, is a good bath... `Drongar` one uninhabitable tropical planet in the Outer Rim, maybe made the little Lord Vader wistfully...

Here goes a little story of Star Wars Trivia:

{% highlight ruby %}
DRONGAR A Planet discovered during the Cone Wars.
Embattled by the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of the Indipendent Systems.
Only system to produce bota, a higly valuable miracle drug.
end

Sometimes we are preoccupied with things that are not important at all!
