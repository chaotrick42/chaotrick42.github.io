You’ll find this page because I finally made myself a `PORTFOLIO PAGE` , now that´s some news. Go ahead and take a look around, I hope to get some new pages and projects, out by end of November. I rebuilded a basic template, so most work was done by `jekyll`, the on e and only blog maker for dummies.

As Jekyll requires a slight blog format, I will go ahead and just make the best out of it:

`Find joy in the little things`

So I go and play with markup `Here` then move to the next block, `HERE` and `THERE` then write down my favourite number `404` and then I start to wonder why you keep reading this.

Here goes a little story of my dog Vader:

{% highlight ruby %}
HE shat in my Hand(really)
ME "What a shitty situation"
end

Sometimes things get dirty but you still like em, like coding!
{% endhighlight %}
